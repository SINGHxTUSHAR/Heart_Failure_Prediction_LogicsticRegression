I have created a heart failure prediction model that will predict heart failure based on age and other attributes. I have used a data set of around 300 data points.

The accuracy achieved is 84.69% by using the Logistic Regression. The accuracy can be quickly increased by increasing the data points or entities.

Different libraries are used in this model to import different methods like Histogram, list, array, and many different methods. Some of these libraries were:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn


The dataset is divided or split from 30% to 70% for the testing and training data respectively.

Model training is done by using the Logistic regression with the balanced data and the model evaluation is performed considering the accuracy score as the evaluation metrics

Data visualization is done using the seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.
